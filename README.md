The Wind is Called Maria

The "music" in this project gets generated every day from publicly available weather data. It uses [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for the sounds, [Speech Synthesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/speechSynthesis) for the voice and [giphy](https://giphy.com/) for the images.

This is a [MakeTimeClub](http://maketime.club) project.
They call the wind Maria ...
